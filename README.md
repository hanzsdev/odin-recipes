# odin-recipes

The Current project is the creation of a HTML website consisting of a main 
index page which will have links to a few recipes. This will be a chance 
for me to practice my html skills and knowledge along with my gained 
understanding of version control using git and github. 

Once I have completed the current project; I hope to have demonsratedd a 
comfortable use of ease that comes from the understanding of how html 
works.
